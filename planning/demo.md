## Script

- Teammate Introduction & background
  - Lucas
  > Hi everyone,
  > My name's Lucas, and I come from a background in food inspection
  - Grace
  > Hi I'm Grace and I have a background in tourism and flooring wholesale industry.
  - Warren
  > And I'm Warren with a background in health care.

- App Intro (Warren)
We're team MealBot and we've created an app for efficient meal planning. Has anyone else ever struggled to decide what to eat or cook at home? I'm sure you all have and so the idea of Mealbot was born. The inspiration behind this idea was mainly due to covid and how staying at home deciding what to eat each day was a time consuming task. Using this app saves time searching for recipes, creates a menu that doesn't repeat, and also cuts down on grocery waste. For the tech stack, we used React, Express, PostgreSQL, and Node.

- Navbar (Warren)
Starting with the navbar, we gave users the ability to use dark mode and also the option to access their user profile in the drop down menu.

- User Profile (Warren)
In the user profiles, your meal plan will be customized based on the preferences you enter. In addition, you can add items you already have at home to exclude them from the grocery list.
  - Point to Preference

- Homepage (Warren)
Next, the homepage which only consists of a button. Users only have one option here, which is to generate the meal plan. After clicking this button, the user is taken to the meal plan page which my group member Grace will talk about.


- Meal plan (Grace)
  > Thank you!
  > The home page button takes you to the meal planner of next week.
  - Point to date header
  > You can navigate to previous weeks to see your meal plan history from here.
  - click previous week button and back to next

  > There is also a save button, and a get grocery list button which is disabled until the meal plan is saved.
  - Point to buttons
  > By clicking the recipe card,
  - Click one recipe
  > you'll see the ingredients, instructions and nutrition info for each recipe.
  - Click through the Tabs
  > The plus and minus button allows you change the serving size.
  - Click plus minus button, click back to meal plan
  > Now back to the meal plan table. We've designed a few ways for you to adjust the meal plan.
  > If you don't like a particular recipe, hover over it and you'll see the button for shuffling recipes.
  - hover recipe and click shuffle a few times
  > If you have a plan to dine out for a certain meal, you can delete it.
  - delete Sunday night
  > But if you really like the recipe, you can also delete another recipe that you don't like, and switch the position by drag and drop
  - Delete Wed Lunch and switch with Saturday Dinner
  > The drag and drop also works if you simply want to switch the order of recipes.
  - DnD again
  > Once you're satisfied with the plan, you can save it.
  - Click save
  > And you won't be able to edit it anymore
  - Show delete, shuffle and DnD disabled
  > Now you can get the grocery list. And I'll hand it off to Lucas to talk about it.
  - Click the grocery list button

- Grocery List (Lucas)
  > Thanks Grace!
  > The grocery list is generated based on the household size in your user profile preferences
  - Start scrolling down the grocery list
  > As we scroll down the grocery list you can see it's organized by aisles, and under each aisle are a list of ingredients
  > But this is a long list and it's inconvenient to scroll through, so we have designed a navigation side bar with links to jump to each aisle
  - Click "Meat", Click the last aisle
  > We've made the grocery list mobile responsive so you can take it on the go, and check the boxes as you grab the things in the store
  - change app size to mobile
  - check box
  > You can then open the aisle sidebar by clicking a button instead
  - open sidebar, click on an aisle
  > There are also features for you to easily share the grocery list with someone else.
  > You can send a text message to the phone number you saved on your profile page.
  - click the twilio button
  - show text message on my phone
  > Or copy the grocery list and send it on some other messaging app.
  - click copy button and paste it into a note
  > These are all the main features of our app.

- Closing
  > We also learned some new tools like Chakra-UI, React Router, React Drag and Drop, Twilio and React Responsive
  > If we had more time to work on it,
    > we'd like to add recipe rating, search bar, and even connect with local stores for online ordering, cost comparison, and coupons.
  > That's our app and we hope you enjoyed it
